from 1 - 8 is that good got 2 min pitch deck for robotesta

Feb 9

Evaluated pitch deck structure and identified inconsistencies needing correction




The flow for slides 1–8 is solid for a 2-minute pitch, Sam. Here's my take:

What works well: The narrative arc is strong — you open with the paradox (AI makes devs faster but releases aren't), explain why (manual QA black hole), show the solution with hard numbers, then land on market + ask. That's a clean story for 2 minutes.

A few things to tighten:

Slide 2 — "Devlopers" has a typo. Small thing, big impression in a pitch competition.
Slide 7 — The Ask says $1.5M Seed, but you're currently raising a $500K pre-seed. You'll want to make sure this matches your actual ask for the Supernova semi-finals, or clarify if you've updated the raise target.
Slide 8 — Team is placeholder (Jane Doe, John Smith, Sara Lee). You'll need to swap in your actual team before tomorrow. This slide is critical — your 15 years in test automation is a major credibility signal.
Slide 5 (How it Works) — For the current GitHub-integrated architecture, you might want to mention the GitHub PR workflow rather than just Jira, since that's the pivot you've made. It differentiates you from competitors.
Slide 6 (Market) — The quadrant visual is clever. Just make sure you can speak to it quickly in under 15 seconds since it's dense.
For pacing across 2 minutes: roughly 15 seconds per slide, which is tight. Slides 2–3 (problem) and 4 (value prop) are where you want to spend the most time. Consider combining or speeding through the market slide.

Overall it's a strong deck for the competition. Want me to help update any of the slides?

how long robotesta could save per user story

Feb 9

Calculated time savings by comparing manual versus automated testing workflows







Based on the numbers in your deck (slide 4), here's the per-user-story breakdown assuming a typical story generates around 3–5 test cases:

Without Robotesta: roughly 7–12 hours per user story (1 hr requirement review + 2–4 hrs writing test cases + 3–5 hrs automation at 1 hr/test + manual execution and maintenance time)

With Robotesta: roughly 10–15 minutes (1 min review + 1–2 min test cases + 6–10 min automation at 2 min/test + automated execution)

So you're looking at ~6–11 hours saved per user story, which is roughly a 95% time reduction.

That's a powerful number for the pitch. If a dev team pushes 20–30 user stories per sprint, that's 120–330 hours saved per sprint — which is where the ~$200K/year figure in your deck comes from.

Want me to help you add a "per user story" stat to the deck? Something like "From 8 hours to 10 minutes per user story" would hit hard in the 2-minute format.

Give me the content for this slide

Feb 9

Architected concise slide content for time-savings pitch

Here's the slide content:

Title: From 8 Hours to 10 Minutes — Per User Story

Left side (Before):

Requirement Review: 1 hour
Test Case Writing: 3 hours
Test Automation: 4 hours (4 test cases × 1 hr)
Execution: Manual
Total: ~8 hours
Right side (With Robotesta):

Requirement Review: 1 minute
Test Case Generation: 2 minutes
Test Automation: 8 minutes (4 test cases × 2 min)
Execution: Automated
Total: ~11 minutes
Bottom tagline: "95% faster. Per story. Every sprint."

Optional supporting stat: "20 stories/sprint × 8 hrs saved = 160 hours back to your team"

This works as either a replacement for slide 4 or an addition right after it. The before/after format mirrors your existing comparison table but makes it more relatable — investors and judges think in "user stories" more easily than abstract QA activities.

Want me to build this into an actual slide in the deck?

this is too much in one slide

Feb 9

Recognized need to distill content into single slide

You're right. For a 2-minute pitch, keep it punchy:

Title: 8 Hours → 10 Minutes Per User Story

Center stat: 95% Time Saved

Tagline: "20 stories per sprint = 160 hours back to your team"

That's it. One bold transformation, one proof point. Let the number do the talking.

no need to calculate the money ?

Feb 9

Weighed financial metrics against time savings value

Good call. For investors, money talks:

Title: 8 Hours → 10 Minutes Per User Story

Center stat: 95% Time Saved

Tagline: "For a team of 10 developers, that's ~$200K/year saved."

Three lines. Time, percentage, money. Done.

8 Hours - 1 hour , how much is the saving , show me the calculations

Feb 9

Deciphered time savings calculation and formulated mathematical breakdown




Here's the math:

Per user story: 8 hrs − ~10 min ≈ 7 hours saved

Per sprint (2 weeks): 7 hrs × 25 stories = 175 hours saved

Per year (26 sprints): 175 × 26 = 4,550 hours saved

In dollars (avg $45/hr developer cost): 4,550 × $45 = ~$204,750

That's where the ~$200K/year comes from for a 10-developer team.

Want me to adjust any of the assumptions (stories per sprint, hourly rate, etc.)?

what is the 1st assumption

Feb 9

Deciphered user's question and identified foundational calculation assumption





The first assumption is 25 user stories per sprint for a 10-developer team.

That's roughly 2.5 stories per developer per sprint, which is a reasonable average. Some teams push more, some less depending on story complexity.

Want me to recalculate with a different number?

for each user story that takes 8 hours , robotesta can get it done in 1 hour do the math assuming having 10 user stories / spribnt

Feb 9

Computed productivity gains from automation efficiency

Per user story: 8 hrs − 1 hr = 7 hours saved

Per sprint: 7 × 10 stories = 70 hours saved

Per year (26 sprints): 70 × 26 = 1,820 hours saved

In dollars ($45/hr): 1,820 × $45 = ~$82K/year

So with these more conservative assumptions, it's ~$82K/year saved for a 10-developer team.

Want to keep the $200K figure in the deck (which assumes higher volume), or go with the more conservative $82K which is easier to defend?

the 82k for 1 tester i think ?

Feb 9

Recalibrated savings estimate by scaling single tester cost appropriately





You're right. That's the saving for 1 QA tester's workload.

A 10-developer team typically has 2–3 testers (roughly 3:1 ratio).

So:

3 testers × $82K = ~$246K/year

That actually validates and even exceeds the ~$200K/year claim in your deck. Solid number to defend in the pitch.

How is it , I need an expert feedback don't sugar coat anything

Feb 9

Resolved to deliver candid, unvarnished critique

Here's my honest assessment, slide by slide:

What improved from v1: Slide 5 is much stronger now with the per-user-story framing. Removing the placeholder team slide and the Ginyard slides cleans things up. The title change on slide 2 ("coding fast but shipping slow") is catchier.

What still needs work:

Slide 2 — "Devlopers" typo is still there. Fix this tonight. Also, the 55%/10% stat needs a source. Judges will ask. If you can't cite it, say "industry reports show" or drop it and use your own data.

Slides 3 and 4 are redundant. You're spending two slides on the same black hole visual with slightly different info. In a 2-minute pitch, that's 30 seconds wasted repeating yourself. Merge them into one. Show the black hole, state the pain points, move on.

Slide 5 — The math doesn't fully add up on the slide itself. You say 8 hrs → 1 hr (that's 87.5%), but then say "Robotesta cut 80% cost and time." Pick one number — 87.5% is more impressive, use that. Also "140 hours saved/month" — show how you got there so it's defensible. And "waste" should be "wasted" in the tagline.

Slide 6 (Market) — No SOM. Investors at a competition will notice. What's your realistic serviceable obtainable market in the first 2–3 years? Even a rough $500M–$1B SOM shows you've thought about it.

Slide 7 (The Ask) — Still says $1.5M Seed. Is that your actual ask for Supernova, or are you raising $500K pre-seed? Mismatching your ask with reality is a red flag for judges.

Missing entirely:

No "How it Works" slide. V1 had it (Connect Jira → AI generates → Run & Report). You removed it. That's a mistake — judges need to understand the product in 10 seconds.
No team slide. For a pitch competition, this is critical. Your 15 years in test automation is your biggest credibility asset. Add it back with real info.
No traction/validation. Even "1 company piloting" or "MVP live" matters. Right now it feels like an idea, not a product.
No demo screenshot or product visual. Everything is text. One screenshot of Robotesta in action inside a GitHub PR would be worth more than two problem slides.
Overall verdict: The story arc is right (problem → impact → market → ask), but you're spending too much time on the problem (3 slides) and not enough on the solution, product, and team. For tomorrow, I'd restructure to:

Title
Problem (one slide, merge 3+4)
Solution — how it works
Impact (slide 5, fix the numbers)
Market
Business model + Ask
Team
Thank you
That's a tighter, more balanced 2-minute pitch. Want me to help draft the missing slides?

Synthesized GitHub-integrated workflow for concise pitch delivery

Title: How Robotesta Works

3 steps, left to right:

1. Push Code → Robotesta auto-triggers on every Pull Request

2. AI Generates → Test cases, automation scripts, and coverage — instantly

3. Ship Confident → Tests run, bugs caught, PR blocked until quality passes

Tagline: "Zero setup. Zero manual testing. Just push code."

This reflects your GitHub PR workflow (not just Jira), which is your real differentiator. Keep it to three steps max — judges need to get it in under 10 seconds.

Synthesized authentic logos for integrated platform visualization








Here's the integration diagram matching your deck's dark theme. It shows the flow: Jira (user stories) → Robotesta (AI generates tests) → GitHub (PR status checks), with animated flow dots.

Note: The Jira icon is a stylized version — for the actual deck, you'll want to swap in the real Jira logo. The GitHub logo is the actual octocat mark. You can screenshot this at 1400×788 which is close to slide dimensions.

what is this chart name

Feb 9

Identified common names for competitive positioning matrices

That's a 2x2 Competitive Matrix (also sometimes called a Magic Quadrant, inspired by Gartner's format).

It positions competitors along two axes — typically something like "Ease of Use" (x-axis) and "Autonomy/Intelligence" (y-axis) — with Robotesta in the top-right "winner" quadrant.

For my case what I name the axis

Feb 9

Analyzed product positioning to determine optimal axis framework




X-axis: Manual Coding → AI-Generated

Y-axis: Fragile → Self-Healing

This puts:

Selenium/Cypress bottom-left (manual + fragile)
Mabl/Testim bottom-right (easier to create but still fragile)
Robotesta top-right (AI-generated + self-healing)
Clean, defensible, and tells your story in one glance.

Audited presentation structure and catalogued formatting inconsistencies




Good progress from v2, Sam. Here's what I see:

What you nailed:

Merged the two problem slides into one (slide 3) — much tighter
Added the How It Works slide with the integration diagram — looks great
Competitive matrix now has real logos — way more credible
Flow is now: Title → Problem → Problem Detail → How It Works → Impact → Market → Ask → Thank You
What's still missing or needs fixing:

"Devlopers" typo — still there on slide 2. Third version, still there. Fix it tonight.
"Savings 7 working hours by just few clicks" (slides 4 & 5) — grammar issue. Should be "Save 7 hours per user story" or "Saving 7 hours with just a few clicks"
Slide 5 — conflicting numbers. You say 87.5% faster but also "cut 80% cost and time." Pick one. 87.5% is the accurate math from 8→1 hr. Drop the 80%.
"waste" → "wasted" on slide 5 bottom tagline.
No team slide. This is the biggest gap. You're pitching at Supernova semi-finals tomorrow — judges want to know who's behind this. Your 15 years in test automation, HEC Paris degree, and consulting for $400M+ startups is a massive trust signal. Even one slide with your name and a one-liner.
Competitive matrix has no axis labels. Add "Manual Coding → AI-Generated" on x-axis and "Fragile → Self-Healing" on y-axis. Without labels, the quadrant doesn't tell the story on its own.
The Ask — $1.5M Seed. Is this your actual ask, or are you raising $500K pre-seed? Make sure this matches reality.
Priority for tonight: Fix the typo, add the team slide, and label the axes. Those three changes will have the biggest impact on judges.

Catalogued standard pitch deck framework for comparative analysis





Here's your deck checked against the standard pitch deck structure where each topic should get a single slide 
Pitch
:

Required Slide	Your Deck	Status
1. Title/Cover	Slide 1 ✅	Clean, good tagline
2. Problem	Slides 2+3	✅ but could be one slide
3. Solution	Slide 4 (How It Works)	✅ Nice integration diagram
4. Product/Demo	—	❌ Missing. No screenshot or demo
5. Market Size	Slide 6	⚠️ Has TAM/SAM but no SOM
6. Competition	Slide 6 (combined with market)	⚠️ Needs axis labels
7. Business Model	Slide 7 (left side)	✅
8. Traction	—	❌ Missing. Even "1 pilot customer, MVP live" counts
9. Team	—	❌ Missing. Critical.
10. The Ask	Slide 7 (right side)	✅
11. Impact/Value Prop	Slide 5	✅ Strong numbers
Three critical gaps for tomorrow:

1. Team slide — investors are investing in you, not your PowerPoint 
Benjamin Ball
. Your 15 years in test automation is your strongest signal. Add one slide before the Ask.

2. Traction slide — your pitch should show proof that people are willing to pay for your product 
Pitch
. Even MVP status, one pilot company, waitlist signups, or LOIs. Anything that shows this isn't just an idea.

3. Product visual — the solution slide should state the ways in which the business solves the problems that your target market is facing 
MasterClass
. Your How It Works is a flow diagram, but judges will want to see the actual product. Even one screenshot of Robotesta generating tests from a user story.

Minor fixes:

Fix "Devlopers" typo
Fix "Savings 7 working hours by just few clicks" grammar
Pick one percentage (87.5% not both 80% and 87.5%)
Add axis labels to the competitive matrix
Confirm if the ask is $500K pre-seed or $1.5M seed
For a 2-minute pitch competition, I'd prioritize adding the team slide above everything else. That's the one judges will notice is missing.

Which tool can take my presentation and refine and oragnize it to be more pretty and professional

Feb 9

Surveyed presentation refinement tools for professional enhancement

Here are the best options, ranked by what would help you most tonight:

Best for quick refinement (what I'd recommend):

Gamma.app — Paste your content and it auto-generates a polished deck with AI. You can import a PDF or paste text. Fastest way to get a professional-looking deck in 30 minutes.

Beautiful.ai — Similar concept, AI-powered layouts that auto-adjust as you add content. Very clean, professional results.

Other solid options:

Tome.app — AI-generated presentations, good for storytelling flow. Can reorganize your narrative.

Canva AI (Magic Design) — You're already in Canva. Try the "Magic Design" feature — it can restyle your existing slides with a more polished template without starting over. This might be your fastest path since everything is already there.

My honest recommendation for tonight: Stay in Canva. You're 12 hours from the competition. Switching tools now risks breaking things. Instead, focus on the content gaps (team slide, traction, typos) rather than making it prettier. A clean deck with the right content beats a beautiful deck missing key slides.

If you want a full redesign after Supernova, Gamma or Beautiful.ai would be worth exploring.

Disambiguated tool identity and formulated versatile presentation prompt


Here's a prompt you can paste directly:

Create a professional 10-slide pitch deck for Robotesta, an AI-powered test automation platform. Dark theme with blue accents. Clean, modern, minimal design.

Slide 1 — Title: Robotesta logo. Tagline: "Your Testing Copilot"

Slide 2 — Problem: "Tech companies are coding fast...but shipping slow." Developers + AI = 55% faster coding, but releases only 10% faster. WHY?

Slide 3 — The Black Hole: 70% of QA is still manual. Releases slip 2-4 weeks. Show a cycle: Write → Execute → Report → Maintain. Call it "The Manual QA Black Hole."

Slide 4 — How It Works: Write User Story → AI Generates Tests → Ship Safe. Robotesta integrates with Jira (reads user stories) and GitHub (PR status checks). 3-step flow diagram.

Slide 5 — Impact: Manual testing: 8 hours per user story. With Robotesta: 1 hour. That's 87.5% faster. For a team of 10 developers, saves ~$200K/year in wasted engineering hours.

Slide 6 — Market: $40B TAM, $15B SAM. 2x2 competitive matrix. X-axis: Manual Coding → AI-Generated. Y-axis: Fragile → Self-Healing. Bottom-left: Selenium, Cypress, Appium. Bottom-right: Mabl, Testim, Katalon. Top-right: Robotesta (winner).

Slide 7 — Traction: MVP live. 1 company piloting. Competing in Supernova AI MEA Semi-Finals at AI Everything Egypt 2026.

Slide 8 — Business Model: Hybrid model. $199/month base + $0.05 per test case after 1,000.

Slide 9 — Team: Sam, Founder & CEO — 15 years in test automation, HEC Paris Master's, consulted for startups that raised $400M+.

Slide 10 — The Ask: Raising $1.5M Seed. Use of funds: 50% Engineering, 30% Go-to-market, 20% Operations. Milestones in 18 months: 100 paying customers, $1M ARR, Series A ready.

Adjust the raise amount if it's still $500K pre-seed. And update the team slide with any co-founders. Good luck tomorrow, Sam!

I already uploaded my slide , so i need cleaning organization , making it more vibrant and beautiful and professional

Feb 9

Identified request to refine existing presentation slides professionally

Redesign and polish my uploaded pitch deck. Keep all existing content and slide order. Make the following improvements:

Design:

Make it more vibrant, modern, and professional
Keep the dark theme but add more visual contrast and depth
Use blue and green accent colors (matching the Robotesta brand gradient)
Add subtle background textures or gradients — avoid flat solid backgrounds
Use clean, bold typography with clear visual hierarchy
Add icons and visual elements to support the text — avoid text-heavy slides
Layout fixes:

Each slide should have one clear focal point — don't overcrowd
Improve spacing and alignment across all slides
Make key numbers and stats large and bold (8 hours, 1 hour, 87.5%, $200K, $40B)
Add visual bars or charts instead of plain text where numbers are compared
Specific slides to improve:

The competitive matrix slide: add axis labels (X: Manual Coding → AI-Generated, Y: Fragile → Self-Healing) and make it visually cleaner
The "How It Works" slide: make the Jira → Robotesta → GitHub flow more visual with arrows and icons
The impact/savings slide: use a visual comparison (progress bars or side-by-side blocks) instead of just text
The Ask slide: make the funding amount and milestones stand out more
Do NOT change the content, messaging, or slide order. Only improve the visual design, layout, and professional polish.

what do you think?

Feb 9

Evaluated presentation design strengths while identifying content gaps



Massive design upgrade, Sam. The visual quality jumped from a 5 to an 8. But there are some content problems to fix before tomorrow:

What looks great:

Slide 2 (Efficiency Paradox) — the progress bars and side-by-side 55% vs 10% is visually powerful. Best slide in the deck.
Slide 5 (ROI) — the bar chart comparison with $200K and 140hrs cards is exactly what investors want to see at a glance.
Slide 6 (Market) — the competitive matrix now has proper axis labels. This is a huge improvement. Robotesta clearly positioned in the winner quadrant.
Slide 7 (Investment) — clean, professional, milestones are easy to scan.
What needs fixing tonight:

Slide 3 is broken. It just says "The Manu" and "Manual testing creates a b" — the content got cut off. This is your problem slide, it's critical. You need the black hole visual with the 70% manual QA stat and the 2-4 week release slip.

Slide 4 is missing the How It Works flow. The Jira → Robotesta → GitHub integration diagram is gone. It's now just a headline with no product visual. You need to add the flow back or at least mention the integrations.

Slide 8 (Team) is empty. Just a placeholder avatar. Fill in your real info: Sam, Founder & CEO — 15 years in test automation, HEC Paris, consulted for startups that raised $400M+.

Minor: Slide 5 still says "waste engineering hours" instead of "wasted."

Bottom line: Fix slides 3, 4, and 8 and this deck is ready for Supernova. The design is now professional enough — focus the next hour on content, not polish.

Very detailed review for the content and mention any edits needed

Feb 9

Prepared comprehensive slide-by-slide pitch deck analysis

Here's my slide-by-slide content review:

Slide 1 — Title ✅ Clean, professional. Logo, tagline, sub-tagline, "Seed Round 2026" and "Confidential" — all good. No changes needed.

Slide 2 — The Efficiency Paradox ✅ Excellent slide. 55% vs 10% contrast is immediately clear. "Faster builds, slower releases. QA is the bottleneck." is a strong punchline. No changes needed.

Slide 3 — Manual QA Black Hole ✅ Fixed from last version. 70% stat is prominent, the Write → Maintain → Execute → Report flow is clean, and "Releases slip 2–4 weeks" in the red warning bar is punchy. No changes needed.

Slide 4 — How It Works ❌ Critical problem. This slide is essentially empty. It says "How It Works" with two arrows and a "Works With" bar at the bottom showing integration icons, but the actual 3-step flow content is missing. You need to add:

Step 1: Write User Story (Jira icon)
Step 2: AI Generates Tests (Robotesta)
Step 3: Ship Safe (GitHub PR Status Checks)
And the tagline: "From user story to bug report in minutes, not days."

This is your solution slide — the single most important slide in a pitch. Right now a judge would see a blank slide. This must be fixed tonight.

Slide 5 — Time & Cost Savings ✅ Much cleaner than previous versions. 8 hours vs 1 hour bar comparison, 87.5% faster, $200K/year. The conflicting 80% is gone. One small addition to consider: add "per 10-dev team" under the $200K so the context is clear without you having to explain it verbally. Otherwise solid.

Slide 6 — Market Opportunity ⚠️ Minor issues.

The competitive matrix is well done with proper axis labels now. Robotesta clearly in the top-right winner quadrant. However:

SAM is missing. Previous version had $15B SAM. Now it only shows $40B TAM. Add SAM back — investors expect TAM/SAM at minimum, ideally TAM/SAM/SOM.
Competitor names are gone. Previous version named Selenium, Cypress, Mabl, Testim, Katalon. Now it just says "Legacy Tools," "Scripted," "Record/Playback," "Code-Based." These are categories, not competitors. Judges want to see you know who you're competing against. Add the actual company names back, even as sub-labels.
Slide 7 — Business Model & Ask ⚠️ Several concerns.

Pricing is missing. The $199/month + $0.05 per test case model from your earlier versions is completely gone. "Business Model" is in the title but there's no actual business model shown — just use of funds. Add your pricing back.
Use of funds has no percentages. Previous version said 50/30/20. Now it's just three labels. Add the split back so investors can see allocation.
Milestones changed significantly. Previous version: 100 paying customers, $1M ARR, Series A ready. New version: GA Self-Healing Engine, 10+ Enterprise Design Partners, SOC2 Compliance. The new milestones are product-focused but miss the revenue signal. Judges want to hear revenue targets. I'd suggest keeping $1M ARR and adding it alongside the product milestones.
$1.5M Seed — is this accurate or are you actually raising $500K pre-seed? Make sure this matches what you'll say verbally.
Slide 8 — Leadership ✅ Great improvement — this slide didn't exist before. Your credentials are strong: 15 years, HEC Paris, $400M+ consulting. Two things to fix:

Replace the placeholder avatar with your actual photo before tomorrow. A gray silhouette signals "unfinished."
Consider adding your full name (not just "Sam") — it looks more professional on a pitch deck.
Slide 9 — Thank You ✅ Clean. Contact info included. No changes needed.

Priority fixes ranked for tonight:

Slide 4 — Add the actual How It Works content (Jira → Robotesta → GitHub flow). This is urgent.
Slide 7 — Add pricing ($199/mo) and fund allocation percentages back.
Slide 8 — Swap placeholder for real photo.
Slide 6 — Add SAM ($15B) and competitor names back.
Slide 5 — Add "per 10-dev team" qualifier to $200K.
Fix slides 4 and 7 at minimum and this deck is competition-ready.

SAM is missing. Previous version had $15B SAM. Now it only shows $40B TAM. Add SAM back — investors expect TAM/SAM at minimum, ideally TAM/SAM/SOM.

What are for my project

Feb 9

Reconsidered market sizing framework for Robotesta's TAM/SAM/SOM






Let me look up current market data to give you defensible numbers.


Synthesized market data to validate TAM, SAM, and SOM figures







Here's what's defensible for Robotesta based on current market data:

TAM: $50B+ The software testing market size was over $54.68 billion in 2025 
Research Nester
, and is set for major expansion, rising to $93.94 billion by 2030 
eeNews Europe
. Your current $40B figure is actually conservative — you could bump it to $50B and still be safe.

SAM: $9B The AI test automation market is projected to reach $35.96 billion by 2032, up from $8.81 billion in 2025, at a CAGR of 22.3% 
MarketsandMarkets
. This is your serviceable market — teams actively adopting AI-powered test automation. Your previous $15B was the broader automation testing segment, which is also defensible, but $9B (AI test automation specifically) is more precise and credible for your story.

SOM: $50M (add this — it's what's missing) This is your realistic 3-year capture. Here's the math: there are roughly 500,000 software teams globally using Jira + GitHub. At $199/mo, each customer is ~$2,400/year. If you capture just 20,000 teams (a tiny fraction), that's $48M. Rounding to $50M is ambitious but realistic enough for a seed pitch.

What to put on the slide:

Value	Label
TAM	$50B	Global Software Testing Market
SAM	$9B	AI-Powered Test Automation
SOM	$50M	Jira + GitHub Teams (3-year target)
The SOM is what makes your market slide credible — it shows judges you're not just throwing big numbers around but have a grounded go-to-market plan.

~1.5 to 2 hours if you focus.

Here's the breakdown:

Fix	Time	Priority
Slide 4 — Add Jira → Robotesta → GitHub flow content back	20 min	🔴 Critical
Slide 6 — Add SAM ($9B) + SOM ($50M) + competitor names	15 min	🔴 Critical
Slide 7 — Add pricing ($199/mo) + fund % split	10 min	🟡 Important
Slide 8 — Swap placeholder for your real photo	5 min	🟡 Important
Final review — Read through all 9 slides once, fix any spacing/alignment	15 min	🟡 Important
Practice the 2-min pitch out loud 3-4 times	20 min	🔴 Critical
If you're short on time, the absolute minimum is slide 4 + practice = 40 minutes. An empty solution slide will hurt you more than anything else.

Don't stay up all night perfecting design. The deck is already visually strong. Content and delivery will win tomorrow.

in slide 1 change this AI that turns user stories into robust test suites and PR checks. to 

i want to change this to something more relvenat and business not technical

Feb 9

Identified need to reframe technical subtitle for business audience

Here are a few options:

Option 1 (ROI-focused): "Ship faster. Test smarter. Save $200K/year."

Option 2 (Bottleneck story): "Eliminating the QA bottleneck so teams ship on time."

Option 3 (Simple & bold): "AI-powered test automation that cuts release cycles by 87%."

Option 4 (Investor-friendly): "Turning QA from a cost center into a competitive advantage."

I'd go with Option 1 — it's punchy, leads with value, and gives judges three reasons to care before you even open your mouth.

in my stage , really how much should i ask for fund ?

Feb 9

Evaluated founder stage and contextualized realistic fundraising expectations


Let me be real with you, Sam. Based on where you actually are:

You should ask for $300K–$500K pre-seed, not $1.5M seed.

Here's why:

Your current stage:

MVP, not yet launched
1 pilot customer (not paying yet)
Solo founder
No revenue
No team on payroll yet
$1.5M seed requires:

Product live in market
5-10+ paying customers minimum
Some MRR traction ($10K-$50K/mo)
Proven retention metrics
$300K–$500K pre-seed gets you to seed-ready:

6 months runway for a 3-dev team
Launch the product
Get 10-20 paying customers
Hit $10K-$15K MRR
Then raise $1.5M seed with proof
My recommendation for the slide:

Change it to "Raising $500K Pre-Seed" and update milestones to:

Launch GA product
20 paying customers
$15K MRR
Seed-ready in 12 months
Asking for $1.5M at MVP stage with no revenue will make experienced investors question your judgment. Asking for $500K shows you understand your stage and have a clear path. It's also much easier to close — you need fewer investors to say yes.

For Supernova judges specifically, a realistic ask signals maturity. Would you like me to help rework slide 7?

Diagnosed frustration and scrutinized recent modifications

Honestly? This is the best version yet. But I see two problems that are probably frustrating you:

Slide 4 — How It Works is STILL broken. Only the first step (Write User Story with Jira icon) is visible. Steps 2 (AI Generates Tests) and 3 (Ship Safe / GitHub) are cut off or missing. This is the third version where this slide fails. The content is there but the layout keeps clipping it.

Slide 8 — Team slide is half empty. Your photo is there now (huge improvement), but your name, title, and credentials are completely missing. No "15 years in test automation," no "HEC Paris," no "$400M+" — just a photo floating on a dark slide.

Everything else actually looks great:

Slide 1 — tagline is perfect now
Slide 3 — best problem slide yet, detailed and clean
Slide 5 — "per 10-dev team" added, numbers are consistent
Slide 6 — TAM/SAM/SOM all there with competitor names on the matrix
Slide 7 — $750K ask, pricing back, milestones with revenue targets, fund split with percentages
Slide 9 — professional close with CTA
You're literally two fixes away from done. Go back into Gespark and fix just those two slides. The content exists, it's just a rendering/layout issue.

Review well , i will submit this version and tell me how many min do i need to pitch it on the stage

12:14 AM

Examined presentation slides and estimated pitch duration

This is it, Sam. Massive improvement from where you started. Here's the final review:

Slide 1 — Title ✅ Perfect. No notes.

Slide 2 — Fast Coding, Slow Releasing ✅ Perfect. No notes.

Slide 3 — Manual QA Black Hole ✅ Perfect. No notes.

Slide 4 — How It Works ✅ FINALLY fixed. All three steps visible, Jira → Robotesta → GitHub flow is clear, tagline at the bottom, integration logos. This was the blocker — it's done.

Slide 5 — ROI & Efficiency ✅ Perfect. No notes.

Slide 6 — Market ✅ TAM/SAM/SOM all there, competitor names on the matrix, 18% CAGR. No notes.

Slide 7 — Business Model & Ask ✅ Pricing, $750K ask, milestones, fund split. All there.

Slide 8 — Team ✅ Real photos, real names, full team of 6. Two small notes:

Your "15 years in test automation" credential is missing — only shows HEC Paris and $400M consulting. That's your strongest signal for this space. Add it back if you can.
Noha Yasser still has a placeholder avatar. Minor, but noticeable.
Slide 9 — Close ✅ Clean, professional, CTA included.

Pitch timing for 9 slides:

Slide	Time	What to say
1 — Title	5 sec	"I'm Sam, founder of Robotesta, your testing copilot."
2 — Paradox	20 sec	Dev speed up 55%, releases only 10% faster. Why?
3 — Problem	20 sec	70% of QA is manual. Releases slip 2-4 weeks.
4 — Solution	25 sec	Write a user story, AI generates tests, ship safe.
5 — ROI	20 sec	8 hours → 1 hour. 87.5% faster. $200K saved per team.
6 — Market	15 sec	$50B market, $9B in AI testing, growing 18% CAGR.
7 — Ask	20 sec	$199/seat, raising $750K, targeting $1M ARR in 18 months.
8 — Team	10 sec	15 years in test automation, HEC Paris, team of 6.
9 — Close	5 sec	"From user story to bug report in minutes. Let's talk."
Total: ~2 minutes 20 seconds

That's tight for a 2-minute slot. To trim it, speed through slides 6 and 8 (10 sec each) and you'll land at exactly 2 minutes.

One last thing: Practice it out loud 3 times before bed. The deck is done. Your delivery is what wins tomorrow. Go crush it. 🚀

revamp this for slide 2 
"Here's a paradox every tech company you invested inis facing right now."
Founders raise money to hire developers so they go to market faster even with AI 
"Developers with AI copilots are writing code 55 percent faster."
[Pause, point to the 10%]
"But releases? Only 10 percent faster."
"So where's the bottleneck?"

12:24 AM

Opted to revise specific script lines rather than regenerate entire document

Here's your revamped Slide 2 script:

SLIDE 2 — FAST CODING, SLOW RELEASING (20 seconds)

[Click to slide 2]

"Here's a paradox every tech company you've invested in is facing right now."

"Founders raise money to hire developers and go to market faster. And with AI copilots, developers are now writing code 55 percent faster."

[Pause, point to the 10%]

"But releases? Only 10 percent faster."

"So where is all that speed going?"

That last line change from "where's the bottleneck" to "where is all that speed going?" is stronger because it mirrors the investor's mindset — they're thinking about ROI on developer spend. And the opening line directly connects to the judges as investors, making it personal.

Want me to regenerate the full document with this update?

"The answer is QA. Seventy percent of quality assurance is still done manually."
"Teams are stuck in an endless cycle: writing tests, executing them by hand, reporting bugs, maintaining brittle scripts."
"The result? Releases slip two to four weeks. Every single sprint., that's why when you ask about relase most probably you hear we need 2 more weeks 

Revamp and polish

12:26 AM

Synthesized QA content with deadline messaging for slide revision

Here's your revamped Slide 3 script:

SLIDE 3 — MANUAL QA BLACK HOLE (20 seconds)

[Click to slide 3]

"The answer is QA. Seventy percent of quality assurance is still done manually."

"Teams are trapped in an endless cycle: writing tests, executing them by hand, reporting bugs, and constantly maintaining brittle scripts."

"The result? Releases slip two to four weeks. Every single sprint."

[Pause, look at the audience]

"That's why when you ask any CTO about a release date, the answer is always the same: 'We just need two more weeks.'"

That closing line is gold, Sam — every investor in the room has heard "two more weeks" before. It turns a statistic into a shared frustration they've personally felt. It'll get nods.

Want me to regenerate the full document with both slide 2 and 3 updates?

That is why we built Robotesta, it eliminates this cycle in three simple steps."
"Step one: your product owner writes a user story in Jira, just like they already do."
"Step two: Robotesta reads that story and automatically generates a full test suite. No scripting. No manual work."
"Step three: those tests run in they cloud and give you the product assessments 
"From user story to bug report in minutes, not days."

Synthesized product pitch into streamlined narrative structure

Here's your revamped Slide 4 script:

SLIDE 4 — HOW IT WORKS (25 seconds)

[Click to slide 4]

"That's why we built Robotesta. It eliminates this entire cycle in three simple steps."

"Step one: your product owner writes a user story in Jira — exactly what they're already doing today. No behavior change."

"Step two: Robotesta reads that story and automatically generates a complete test suite. No scripting. No manual work. Just click and go."

"Step three: those tests run in the cloud and deliver a full product quality assessment — before anything ships."

[Pause]

"From user story to bug report in minutes, not days."

Key changes:

"No behavior change" — reassures investors there's no adoption friction, which is a top concern
"Just click and go" — makes it feel effortless
"Full product quality assessment" — sounds more valuable than just "test results"
"Before anything ships" — creates urgency and positions Robotesta as a safety gate
Want me to regenerate the full document with all four slide updates?

Let move to the plan for the 2day events, we will be 6 members 

The event has a lot of opportunities, Companies, Enterprise that might have programs for the startups, Government might have initiative, Investors, Accelerator and many more so list for me all segments that will be in the event and let's think in a plan how to get the best from them

12:35 AM

Catalogued event segments and architected team strategy framework





Great thinking, Sam. Based on the research, here are all the segments at AI Everything Egypt 2026:

SEGMENT 1: Global Tech Enterprises (Potential Customers & Partners) Microsoft, Cisco, HPE, Red Hat, AWS, Capgemini, Dataiku, e& Egypt, Fortinet, HCLTech — these companies have dev teams that need test automation. They're also potential design partners or integration partners.

SEGMENT 2: Regional Tech Companies (Potential Customers) Alkan, Cyshield, Link Data Center, WideBot AI, EZELINK, Odoo, ZIWO, Zakaa, Barq Systems — mid-market companies that are your ideal customer profile. They use Jira + GitHub and feel QA pain daily.

SEGMENT 3: Investors & VCs (Fundraising) The event has a dedicated Investor Programme with curated 1-on-1 meetings. VCs from 60+ countries. Plus Supernova judges themselves are investors. You already have the Masabeeh Partners lead and the Nanis El Essaily / Raya Holding meeting.

SEGMENT 4: Accelerators & Incubators GITEX ecosystem typically brings Flat6Labs, 500 Global, Techstars, Y Combinator scouts, Plug and Play, and regional programs. These can give you funding + mentorship + customer intros.

SEGMENT 5: Government & Policy Bodies MCIT (host), ITIDA (strategic partner), World Bank, EBRD, UNDP, UN Environment Programme, UAE Cybersecurity Council. These entities run startup support programs, grants, and procurement initiatives.

SEGMENT 6: Fellow AI Startups (AI 300 cohort) 300+ AI startups from 30+ countries. Potential collaboration, knowledge sharing, and co-selling partnerships. Also competitive intelligence.

SEGMENT 7: Media & Press AraGeek (you already have a lead), plus international tech media covering the event. PR visibility for fundraising and customer acquisition.

SEGMENT 8: Speakers & Thought Leaders Cerebras, Tenstorrent reps, ministers, CxOs on panels. High-value networking targets who are hard to reach outside events.

Now, you have 6 people and 2 days. Want me to build a tactical deployment plan — assigning team members to segments, with specific goals, talking points, and a schedule?

yes

12:39 AM

Awaited collaborative input to construct tactical strategy




Let me get a couple of things clear first so the plan is sharp:

This will help me build a plan that's specific to your situation rather than generic. Drop me the details and I'll map it out.

A: I'll type them out

Q: What's your #1 priority from this event?
A: All equally important

Q: Do you have a booth/stand at the event?
A: Yes, we have a booth

12:41 AM

Awaited team member information before proceeding strategically

Go ahead — type out the 6 names and their roles, and I'll build the full 2-day battle plan around them.

I need to scrap all the data of exhibitors on the website

12:50 AM

Synthesized exhibitor data from alternative sources instead

















Sam, here's the situation: the AI Everything Egypt website is JavaScript-rendered and blocks scraping — there's no public exhibitor directory page I can access programmatically. However, I've pulled exhibitor data from every press release, news article, and official source available. Let me compile it all into a spreadsheet for your team.


Assembled spreadsheet and evaluated data extraction constraints









Here's your exhibitor intel spreadsheet with 42 confirmed exhibitors/participants across 3 tabs:

Tab 1 — Exhibitors: Every company with category, sector, HQ, relevance to Robotesta, priority ranking, why to target them, team member assignment, and contact name fields ready to fill.

Tab 2 — Summary: Count by category (19 HIGH priority, 14 MEDIUM, 9 LOW).

Tab 3 — By Team Member: Who's assigned to visit which companies.

Important caveat: The AI Everything Egypt website doesn't have a public exhibitor directory — it's fully JavaScript-rendered and blocks scraping. This list is compiled from every press release, government source, and news article I could find. The actual event has 350+ companies, so there are likely 300+ exhibitors I couldn't capture.

My recommendation for tomorrow: When you arrive, grab the printed exhibitor guide or event app immediately and have Ann or Noha photograph every page. That's where the complete list will be. Use this spreadsheet as your pre-research hit list and add new targets on the fly.

List for me all VCs and where to find them and their investment area

1:27 AM

Synthesized investor data into organized, location-specific recommendations
















Sam, here's the reality: the event doesn't publish a named VC list — they just say "200+ global investors" through the GITEX network. But here's everything I've pieced together from all sources, organized by where to find them and how relevant they are to your $500K pre-seed round.

WHERE VCs WILL BE AT THE EVENT
1. Investor Programme (dedicated zone with curated 1-on-1 meetings) This is your #1 hunting ground. GITEX events typically station VCs here with scheduled meeting slots. Get there early Day 1 and sign up for as many 1-on-1s as possible.

2. Supernova Semi-Finals / Finals (the judges + audience) The judges ARE investors. After your pitch, approach every judge. Your opener: "I just pitched — I'd love 5 minutes to continue the conversation."

3. AI 300 Zone (300 startups from 30 countries) VCs roam this area looking for deals. Be visible here.

4. GITEX ScaleX House (closed-door VC-backed scaleup zone) VCs with active portfolios will be here. Try to get access or network outside.

Techstars	Possible	Global accelerator	GITEX network regular
Plug and Play	Possible	Corporate accelerator	Active in MENA
Y Combinator scouts	Possible	Scout network at events	Not official but scouts attend GITEX events
YOUR ACTION PLAN FOR VCs TOMORROW
Morning (Day 1):

Go straight to the Investor Programme registration — sign up for every available 1-on-1 slot
Ask the organizer: "Can I see the list of participating investors?" — they often have a printed directory
Scan the event app (if available) and filter by "Investor" badge type
Before your 11:30 Supernova pitch: 4. Note every judge's name and firm. They ARE your warm leads post-pitch.

After your pitch: 5. Approach judges immediately with: "I'd love to continue the conversation — are you free for 5 minutes?" 6. Floor-hunt the Investor Programme zone and AI 300 area

Your qualifying pitch for VCs (30-second version):

"We're Robotesta — GitHub Copilot for QA. Developers are coding 55% faster with AI but releases are only 10% faster because QA is still 70% manual. We auto-generate tests from Jira stories and block PR merges until quality is verified. We're raising a $500K pre-seed — interested in a quick demo?"

Key ask for every VC you meet:

"Who else should I be talking to here?"

This single question will unlock the hidden investor network at the event. Good luck tomorrow, Sam! 🔥

Regarding the categorization for the 249 companies, do you know that every product based company is a potential client ? can you consider that and repriortize

10:48 AM

Reconsidered prioritization framework to encompass all product-based companies



Great point — if they build any software product, they need QA, period. Let me recategorize with that lens: every product company gets bumped up.


Reconsidered prioritization framework to elevate product-based companies



You're absolutely right — if they build a product, they have dev teams, and dev teams need QA. Let me reclassify all 249 with that lens and rebuild the Excel.


Recategorized companies elevating product-based firms to priority status






Good — went from 23 HIGH to 76 HIGH and identified 209 product companies (84% of exhibitors!). Now let me build the full workbook with team assignments.


Reconsidered company prioritization accounting for product-based potential


Here's the reprioritized list. The shift is massive:

Before → After:

Priority	Before	After	Change
HIGH	23	76	+53 🔺
MEDIUM	165	135	-30
LOW	61	36	-25 🔻
The key insight: 209 out of 247 exhibitors (84%) are product companies. Every single one has dev teams that need QA.

What changed:

Every AI startup building a SaaS/platform → bumped to HIGH (40 AI product companies alone)
Cybersecurity companies that build products (not just resell) → MEDIUM or HIGH
Vertical startups (HealthTech, FinTech, EdTech) with real software products → MEDIUM
Only 36 companies stayed LOW (distributors, resellers, training providers, pure services)
🚨 New competitor spotted:

Inspect Via Me (H1-P163, India) — AI-powered QA testing platform using Agentic AI. Direct competitor. Assigned to you for scouting alongside NTG Clarity.

Now we have 1 / 8 for our targets , right ?
what are the remaning 7 ?

10:59 AM

Hunted for missing battle plan segments within available context




Let me check the battle plan to recall all 8 segments.


Inventoried eight target segments and assessed completion status across categories








Good question. Here are the 8 target segments from the battle plan, and where we stand:

#	Segment	Owner	Status
A	Investors & VCs	Sameh	✅ Done — 30+ MENA VCs researched, qualifying pitch ready
B	Enterprise Companies (Customers)	Khadiga + Alen	✅ Done — in exhibitor list (76 HIGH priority) + CEO contacts
C	Regional Tech Companies (Mid-Market)	Alen + Ann	✅ Done — in exhibitor list
D	Government & Policy Bodies	Sameh + Ahmed	⚠️ Partial — MCIT/ITIDA identified, but no deep research on specific programs/grants
E	Accelerators & Incubators	Ahmed	❌ Not done — no research on which accelerators are attending
F	Media & Press	Noha	❌ Not done — AraGeek lead exists, but no press kit or media plan
G	Fellow AI Startups (AI 300)	Ann	✅ Done — in exhibitor list
H	Speakers & Thought Leaders	Sameh	❌ Not done — no research on who's speaking / panel schedules
So really 4 out of 8 are covered (A, B+C, G). The remaining work is:

Government programs — what grants/support ITIDA and MCIT offer for AI startups
Accelerators — which ones are at the event, cohort deadlines
Media/Press — press kit, Noha's media target list
Speakers — who's on panels, which sessions to attend for networking
Want me to start knocking these out? Which one first?

Could you create a new tab in the sheet and add Investors & VCs and there booth or locations 

and Same for Government & Policy Bodies & Accelerators & Incubators & Media & Press

Deliberated optimal task management integration strategies



Good thinking — the sheet is great for planning but not ideal for live tracking on the floor tomorrow. Let me ask what you're already working with:

Since the event is tomorrow morning, the solution needs to be fast to set up and easy for all 6 team members to use on their phones while walking the floor. Let me know what tools you're using and I'll build the best option right away.

Q: What does your team currently use for task/project management? (Select all that apply)
A: I need a pp where i can take note mark done

Q: How should the team track leads & visits during the event?
A: Interactive web app I can open on phone

11:53 AM

Architected mobile-first React app for event lead tracking and task management




Let me build you a mobile-first event tracker app with all your targets, notes, and done/not-done tracking.


Synthesized user preferences for task management and event tracking solutions



Here's your AIE Tracker — a mobile-first app you can open on your phone right at the event. Here's what's inside:

6 tabs:

Hit List — all 47 HIGH priority exhibitors with search, team filter, checkboxes, and notes per company
Investors — 16 VCs/DFIs organized by tier (T1-T4) with booth locations and exact action steps
Government — 6 targets with programs/grants to ask about
Accelerators — 8 accelerators with investment ranges and actions
Media — 5 media targets for Noha
Leads — quick capture form (name, company, role, email, segment, next step)
Key features:

✅ Tap to mark done (turns green, progress bar updates)
📝 Expand any card to add notes
🔍 Search by company or booth number
👤 Filter by team member
💾 Data persists between sessions
Open it on your phone tomorrow and start checking off targets as you go. Good luck at Supernova! 🚀

Can I open it from the browser ?

11:58 AM

Clarified artifact accessibility across platforms and interfaces




Yes! You can interact with it right here in this chat — click on the artifact preview above and it'll open as a full interactive app.

To use it on your phone tomorrow:

Open this conversation in the Claude app (iOS/Android) or in your mobile browser at claude.ai
Tap the artifact to open it full-screen
Bookmark it for quick access during the event
Your data (checkmarks, notes, leads) will persist across sessions thanks to the storage API.

One thing to note though — this lives inside Claude's interface, so it's not a shareable URL you can send to the whole team. If you want the team to each have access, they'd each need to open this conversation.

Want me to make any changes to it? For example adding/removing companies, changing assignments, or tweaking the layout?

can i publish it publicky on a link

Devised standalone HTML solution for effortless public deployment




Not directly from Claude — artifacts only run inside this interface. But I can convert it to a standalone HTML file that you can host for free in 2 minutes. Here's the easiest option:

Let me build it as a single HTML file you can publish in 2 minutes via Netlify Drop — no account needed, just drag and drop.


Formulated publishing instructions for public link sharing


Here's your standalone HTML file. To get it live on a public link in 2 minutes:

Netlify Drop (fastest, no account needed):

Go to app.netlify.com/drop
Drag and drop the aie-tracker.html file
You get a public URL instantly (something like random-name.netlify.app)
Share that link with the whole team
The data saves to each person's phone via localStorage, so everyone's checkmarks and notes stay separate and persist between visits.

Want me to tweak anything before you deploy?

Q: How would you like to publish it?
A: I have GitHub (deploy to GitHub Pages)

12:03 PM

Formulated GitHub Pages deployment instructions

Here's exactly what to do — should take about 3 minutes:

Step 1: Create a new repo

Go to github.com/new
Name it aie-tracker
Set it to Public
Click Create repository
Step 2: Upload the file

Click "uploading an existing file" on the empty repo page
Drag and drop the aie-tracker.html file you just downloaded
Rename it to index.html (this is important — GitHub Pages looks for index.html)
Click Commit changes
Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

Go to Settings → Pages (left sidebar)
Under "Source" select Deploy from a branch
Branch: main, folder: / (root)
Click Save
Step 4: Get your link (takes ~60 seconds to deploy)

Your app will be live at:

https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/aie-tracker/
Share that link with the whole team — everyone opens it on their phone, adds to home screen, and they're ready for tomorrow.

Want me to make any last-minute changes before you deploy?

How to uodate the deloyed version on github

12:27 PM

Deciphered user's intent regarding GitHub Pages deployment updates

Simple — go to your repo on GitHub:

Open github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aie-tracker
Click Add file → Upload files
Drag and drop the updated index.html (the tracker) and lead-form.html
GitHub will ask to overwrite — that's fine
Click Commit changes
Give it ~60 seconds and your live site updates automatically.

Your links will be:

Tracker: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/aie-tracker/
Lead form: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/aie-tracker/lead-form.html
💡 Pro tip for tomorrow: Add both links to your phone's home screen — open each in Safari/Chrome → tap Share → Add to Home Screen. They'll look and feel like native apps.

Can you add the lead form to the main to do one , so all of them be on one link

12:28 PM

Consolidated multiple forms into unified single link







All-in-one now — 6 tabs, 1 link. The Leads tab has the full-featured form built in:

➕ New Lead — name, company, role, email/phone, segment chips, interest chips, captured by, notes
📋 All Leads — search, filter by segment, tap for detail view
Detail view — one-tap Email / Call / WhatsApp buttons
📥 CSV export — download all leads as a spreadsheet
Just upload this index.html to your GitHub repo (replace the old one), and everything lives at one URL. Ready to go for tomorrow! 🚀

Screenshot 2026-02-10 at 12.38.01 PM.png
it's not the same

12:38 PM

Identified outdated deployment requiring repository update



That's still the old version on GitHub. You need to replace it with the new file you just downloaded. Here's the quick fix:

Go to github.com/samelnabawy/aie-tracker
Click on index.html
Click the pencil icon ✏️ (top right of the file)
Press Ctrl+A (select all) → Delete
Open the new index.html you downloaded from me → open it in any text editor (TextEdit, VS Code, etc.) → Ctrl+A → Ctrl+C
Go back to GitHub → Ctrl+V (paste)
Click Commit changes
The new version has the enhanced Leads tab with segment chips, interest buttons, captured by, separate email/phone fields, CSV export, and lead detail view with WhatsApp/Call/Email buttons.

Alternatively, you can just delete the old file and upload the new one — same result.
